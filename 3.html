<p>Sweatcoin functions by connecting to a smartphone’s built-in fitness data and GPS locator. From there, the app counts how many steps the user takes based on their movement. This means those looking to acquire coins have to keep their GPS active, as the app won’t work on a treadmill or other stationary devices. For every 1,000 steps a person takes they earn 0.95 Sweatcoins</p>
